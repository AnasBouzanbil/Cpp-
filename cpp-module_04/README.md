# C++ Introduction (cpp00)

## What is a Class?

In C++, a class defines a data type, similar to a struct in C. It encapsulates variables and functions, with these members usually set to private.

## What is a Type?

A type in C++ consists of both a set of states and a set of operations.

## What is an Object?

An object, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is an instance of a class. It holds data (attributes/variables) and behavior (methods/functions), promoting modular and reusable code.

## What is a Namespace?

A namespace is a C++ feature that helps group code elements within a specific scope to avoid naming conflicts. It's crucial when working on projects involving multiple contexts, such as national and international aspects of countries.

### Namespace Example:

```cpp
namespace National {
    class Morocco {
        // Class definition for the national context
    };
}

namespace International {
    class Morocco {
        // Class definition for the international context
    };
}
```

Now, if you want to access the class of Morocco nationally, you can do something like National::Morocco.



## Namespace Explanation
A namespace is a feature in C++ that allows you to group related code elements within a specific scope to avoid naming conflicts. Consider an example where naming conflicts can occur. Imagine working on a project that involves both national and international aspects of countries. You might need separate classes to represent these contexts, such as "Morocco National" and "Morocco International." However, directly defining two classes with the same name would result in an error.

</p>

To handle this situation, we can use namespaces. Here's an example:

```cpp
class MoroccoNational {
    // Class definition for the national context
};

class MoroccoInternational {
    // Class definition for the international context
};
```
In the code above, the class names are identical, which would lead to an error.

To resolve this naming conflict using namespaces, we can define the classes within separate namespaces:

```cpp
namespace National {
    class Morocco {
        // Class definition for the national context
    };
}

namespace International {
    class Morocco {
        // Class definition for the international context
    };
}
```

Now, if you want to access the class representing Morocco in the national context, you can use National::Morocco. Similarly, to access the class representing Morocco in the international context, you would use International::Morocco.

By utilizing namespaces, we can effectively organize our code and prevent naming conflicts, thereby improving code maintainability and readability.

## Copy Constructor Vs Copy Assignment Operator
I was confused by two concepts, but fortunately, I have gained a clear understanding of them. Let's start with what a constructor is.

A constructor is a special member function inside a class that is called when an object is created. One type of constructor is the Copy Constructor.

The Copy Constructor is a special constructor that creates a new object based on an existing one. It is called when you want to initialize a new object with an existing object. Consider the following example:


```cpp
class Object {
    // Object implementation...
};

int main() {
    Object one;
    Object two = one; // Copy Constructor is called here
}
```

In this example, the constructor that would be called is the Copy Constructor.

The syntax for the Copy Constructor is as follows:

```cpp
Object(const Object& existing) {
    // Your implementation
}
```
